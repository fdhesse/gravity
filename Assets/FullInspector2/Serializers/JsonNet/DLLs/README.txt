## Json.NET Customizations

The build of Json.NET that Full Inspector ships with has been slightly customized; the dependency on sockets has been stripped.

The files used to build Json.NET are available in `Newtonsoft.Json Build Files.zip`.

If you have installed the alternative Json.NET package, you can safely delete this directory.
